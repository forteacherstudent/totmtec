# Django Test Project

## Introduction:
This Django app simply show list of available departments in the
system as well as number of employees in each department, average 
salary and whether any of those employees has retired 
(i.e their age exceeded 60 years).

Data are obtained through an AJAX request.

We use Django Rest Framework
for writing the API endpoint `/departments/departments/`.

## Requirements
The app is already working properly however it's very poorly coded
and has very bad performance.

Your task is to modify the code in order to make it more efficient
and more compliant with Django's best practices.

### Notes:
* We only evaluate your python code so doing changes to 
  html template or css will not be taken into consideration.
* Please commit your changes as you work in the project with proper
  commit messages. \[ *use git commands* ]
* The project is meant to test your Django and Django Rest Framework
  skills so changing the project in such a way that it no longer 
  make use of DRF will automatically disqualify your application.
* Project also evaluate your `git` skills so we expect to see
  multiple commits with meaningful commit messages.
  projects with uncommitted code or a single commit entry are also disqualified.

## Installing and Running the app
Create and activate a virtualenv as usual.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required libraries.
Run `./manage runserver` to start the app.

## Delivery
We expect candidates to complete and send the project within 24 hours.

After you finish working on the project please compress the project 
directory and send it back to us.

## Happy Coding!!
